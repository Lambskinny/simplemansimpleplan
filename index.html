  <p>Here is a simple plan to live life.</p>
  <p>  1. Love God.</p>
  <p>  2. Love your neighbor.</p>
  <p>That's it. If you love God, you will invite Him into your heart and be saved. This will take care of some of the 10 Commandments.</p>
  <p>If you love your neighbor, you will take care of the rest of the 10 Commandments.</p>

  <p>Remember, Jesus died for your sins. All, not some. All people. All sin.</p>

  <p>You are saved by grace, not by what you do.</p>

  <p>  -8. For it is by grace you have been saved, through faith—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God— 9. not by works, so that no one can boast. -NIV</p>
